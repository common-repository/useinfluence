UseInfluence uses 'Social Proof Notifications' to give a conversion BOOST to your website's traffic. Our realtime notifications puts a stamp of Social Proofing on your online business/website, and eventually creates a feeling of trust in your website visitors.

== Description ==

It's a No-Brainer for conversions which runs automatically on your website!

What are Influence Notifications? 
Influence picks up the real time events data from your website & displays it on 'Social Proof Notifications'. These are classified into 'Recent Activity', 'Bulk Activity' & 'Live Visitors'. 
Everything is fully customizeable! You can set the 'Styles' & 'Behaviors' of your notification popups from Influence dashboard. Add-on: Influence Analytics - You can also monitor analytics, conversion % & several other metrics.


How does these notifications help? 
Think of this as a 'Social stamping' by your existing customers/users which is flashed to your new prospective customers. After seeing the activities of existing users, your website visitors are more likely to convert & make a purchase. It's a scientifically proven psychological phenomenon for customer buying behaviours.


What are the benefits? Some websites have seen over 200% conversion improvements after installing 'Influence'. On an average Influence users measure about 25-30% improvements over their existing conversions.


Does Influence collect & store any data from the websites (or of website users)? 
Yes, our analytics code collect only the relevant information from your website like visitor emails, visitor journey, location, time-stamps etc., which are essential to the product feature delivery. NO sensitive information is being picked or stored by Influence. Data Storage - All the data is being stored in Google Cloud servers located in "Central USA". Influence is GDPR compliant, which means that all the Influence customers & users (direct or indirect) have the ultimate control over their data. Any user can choose to hide or delete its data from our servers, for doing this you have to write to our Support ('Support@useinfluence.co') using the connected email-id which you own & want us to delete/hide from our servers.

{Note: Influence notifications don't show any sensitive user information which may give away their identities.}

We insert this universal tracking script which collects event information from the website and sends it to our servers where we process it and serves it in high quality notifications & analytics.
